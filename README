A fork of the Finite State Machine that is a part of the tungsten replicator. The original project can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/tungsten-fsm/

Why fork?
* Upstream says "This project will not be further maintained"
* Migrate the code to use SLF4J instead of log4j
* Use maven to manage the build
